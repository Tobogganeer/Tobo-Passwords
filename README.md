# Tobo-Passwords
Wanted to see just how quickly I could create my own password manager to store encrypted passwords offline.

With the help of StackOverflow, it took only a few hours.
<br> Runs from a single source file, support for multiple password 'banks', each with a seperate password.
<br> Passwords encrypted with standard AES256, configuring min password length
<br> This 600 line script should be relatively self explanatory to use.
